# FoldBench: An All-atom Benchmark for Biomolecular Structure Prediction

![Abstract](./assets/fig1_abstract.png)


FoldBench is a low-homology benchmark that spans proteins, nucleic acids, ligands, and six major interaction types, enabling assessments that were previously infeasible with task-specific datasets.


## Repository Structure

The FoldBench repository is organized to separate benchmark data, evaluation code, and evaluation sample.

## 🎯 FoldBench Targets
The FoldBench benchmark targets are open-source. This comprehensive dataset, located in the `targets` directory, is organized into two primary collections:

### **Interfaces**

* **Protein–Protein:** 279 interfaces,
* **Antibody–Antigen:** 172 interfaces
* **Protein–Ligand:** 558 interfaces
* **Protein–Peptide:** 51 interfaces
* **Protein–RNA:** 70 interfaces
* **Protein–DNA:** 330 interfaces

### **Monomeric Structures**

* **Protein Monomers:** 330 structures
* **RNA Monomers:**  15 structures
* **DNA Monomers:** 14 structures

## 🏆 Leaderboard

Scores represent the success rate for interface prediction tasks and LDDT for monomer prediction tasks.

**Note:**
- Interface prediction is evaluated by success rate.
- Monomer prediction is evaluated by LDDT.
- Success is defined as:
  - For protein–ligand interfaces: LRMSD < 2 Å and LDDT-PLI > 0.8
  - For all other interfaces: DockQ ≥ 0.23

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with FoldBench, clone the repository and set up the Conda environment.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/FoldBench.git
cd FoldBench

# 2. Create and activate the Conda environment for evaluation
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate foldbench
```

## ⚙️ Evaluation
You can use our provided evaluation samples to reproduce the evaluation workflow. The final results will be generated in `examples/summary_table.csv`.

```bash
# Ensure you are in the FoldBench root directory and the conda environment is active

# Step 1: Calculate per-target scores from prediction files
# This uses OpenStructure (ost) and DockQ to score each prediction against its ground truth
python evaluate.py \
  --targets_dir ./examples/targets \
  --evaluation_dir ./examples/outputs/evaluation \
  --algorithm_name Protenix \
  --ground_truth_dir ./examples/ground_truths

# Step 2: Aggregate scores and calculate the final success rates/LDDT
# This summarizes the results for specified models and tasks into a final table
python task_score_summary.py \
  --evaluation_dir ./examples/outputs/evaluation \
  --target_dir ./examples/targets \
  --output_path ./examples/summary_table.csv \
  --algorithm_names Protenix \
  --targets interface_protein_ligand interface_protein_dna monomer_protein \
  --metric_type rank
```

### Evaluate more structures
To evaluate more structures in FoldBench, you'll need to follow these steps:

#### **1. Prepare Your Data**

* **Edit the target CSV files:** Modify the CSV files located in the `examples/targets` directory. These files should contain information about the structures you want to evaluate.
* **Download ground truth CIF files:** A package containing specific original CIF files referenced during the benchmark's creation is available for download here: [FoldBench Referenced CIFs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17KdWDXKATaeHF6inPxhPHIRuIzeqiJxS/view?usp=sharing). Save these files in the `examples/ground_truths` directory. Ensure the filenames correspond to your data in the CSV files.


#### **2. Update Evaluation Outputs**

* **Modify `prediction_reference.csv`:** After preparing your data, you'll need to adjust the `./outputs/evaluation/{algorithm_name}/prediction_reference.csv` file to specify the model's ranking scores and the paths to the predicted structures. Please refer to the **[Integrating a New Model into FoldBench](./algorithms/README.md)**.
